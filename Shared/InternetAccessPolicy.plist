			<string>Websites are redesigned without advance notice. To keep up with this, Shut Up uses [a stylesheet on my server](https://rickyromero.com/shutup/updates/shutup.css) to block comments. It checks this file for updates every 2 days. This is only for maintaining effective comment blocking â€“ [Shut Up doesn&apos;t track you](https://rickyromero.com/shutup/privacy/).</string>
			<key>DenyConsequences</key>
			<string>Permanently denying this connection may gradually degrade Shut Up&apos;s comment blocking as websites are redesigned.</string>
